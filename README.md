Key Insights 

Market Cap vs. Earnings:
Reliance Industries has the largest market cap (₹19,92,127 Cr) but a relatively modest P/E ratio of 28.98. This suggests that the market views it as reasonably valued given its earnings, despite its large size.
Despite having a smaller market cap (₹9,95,118 Cr), Bharti Airtel has the highest P/E ratio of 83.32, indicating a higher market valuation relative to earnings, potentially due to growth expectations.

Debt Structure:
High Debt Companies: HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, and ICICI Bank have higher debt levels, which may indicate a reliance on borrowing for expansion. Investors might scrutinize these companies for their ability to service debt, especially if interest rates rise.
Low Debt Companies: Reliance Industries and TCS have lower debt, which can signal better financial health and a lower risk profile.

Earnings per Share (EPS) & Profitability:
TCS has the highest EPS (₹129.20) and a strong profit margin, making it a solid performer in terms of shareholder returns.
ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank also have notable EPS values of ₹64.56 and ₹89.75, respectively, showing they generate significant earnings relative to their shares.

Ownership Trends:
Promoter Holdings: TCS's 71.77% promoter holdings indicate strong insider confidence in the company’s future. 
Change in Holdings: Bharti Airtel shows a decline in promoter holdings (-0.32%), potentially signaling reduced insider confidence.

Foreign and Domestic Institutional Investments:
HDFC Bank has the highest FII holding at 47.17%, highlighting strong international investor interest. On the other hand, Bharti Airtel shows a modest gain in FII holdings (+0.27%), indicating rising interest.
DII Trends: ICICI Bank has a high DII holding (44.45%) but shows a decline of -0.65%, which could suggest domestic institutions reducing their stakes.
